# Overview

Hello! This is my Javascript repo.

I will be writing a memory game written in Javascript. I like to play memory games and it would be awesome if I can build it in Javascript.
There is a similar memory game that I found in Youtube and has an unfinished code (links below). I used the unfinished code as the start of the program and watched the video for tips on how he did his program. The original authors code program uses player lives whereas I just tracked the number of moves or comparisons. The thought was to be able to save your best score and make that the goal of the player to be able to beat and update the top score. However, I found a snag since cookies do not work on Chrome. You have to use Firefox since it allows cookies. The score ranges program shows a graph of score ranges as it pertains to the memory game. 
Enjoy. Happy gaming.

# Future Work

I would like to be able to save the high score into a file instead of a cookie. Then the score will be compared to that value in the file and update when that score is beat.
